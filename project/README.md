security number, name, address, telephone number, sex, title, salary, and
college degrees. The address includes street address, city, state, and zip
code. The telephone number includes the area code and 7 digit number.

and a chairperson who is a professor.
3. Each course has a unique number, title, textbook, units. Each course also
has a set of prerequisite courses. Each course is offered by a department.
4. Each course may have several sections. Each section has a section number
that is unique within the course, a classroom, a number of seats, meeting
days, a beginning time, an ending time. Each section is taught by a professor.
5. The database keeps student records, including the campus wide ID, name,
address, and telephone number. Each student majors in one department and
